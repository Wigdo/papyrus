<pre>
I am a thing of the world, vicious, wild, untamed, unkempt, brave, stoic,
<strong>bold</strong>.
I am a thing manifold.
I have seen the seaward waves blown back
I have seen the world run amok.
I have tasted pleasure and withered pain,
I am noble, I am sane.
My thirst for life is unquenchable pursuit,
I stand in grace
I lunge claw and uproot.
I am nature's image placed in a thing,
I am grand
I am
