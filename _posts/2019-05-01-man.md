## Man ##

<br> I am a thing of the world, <br />
<br> vicious, wild, untamed, unkempt, brave stoic, <br />
<br> bold. <br />
<br> I am a thing manifold. <br />
<br> I have seen the seaward waves blown back <br />
<br> I have seen the world run amok.<br/>
<br> I have tasted pleasure and withered pain,
<br> I am noble, I am sane.
<br> My thirst for life is unquenchable pursuit,
<br> I stand in grace
<br> I lunge claw and uproot.
<br> I am nature's image placed in a thing,
<br> I am grand
<br> This bestial thing
