## Man ##

I am a thing of the world, <br />
vicious, wild, untamed, unkempt, brave stoic, <br />
bold. <br />
I am a thing manifold. <br />
I have seen the seaward waves blown back <br />
I have seen the world run amok.<br/>
I have tasted pleasure and withered pain,
I am noble, I am sane.
My thirst for life is unquenchable pursuit,
I stand in grace
I lunge claw and uproot.
I am nature's image placed in a thing,
I am grand
This bestial thing
