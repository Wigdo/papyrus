## Completed books ##
*  《活着》 余华 - To Live by Yu Hua

  This is a story about a man named 福贵 (lit. 'Lucky') who loses his family fortune by gambling it away. But for Lucky, in retrospect, losing his family's fortune becomes a blessing in disguise as the Chinese Communist Party (共产党) comes to his village and executes the wealthy landowners there. It is a story of cruel hardship and suffering but reads as if it were a light-hearted story; Lucky himself (the narrator) faces adversity with fierce optimism.



## What I'm currently reading ##
* 《沉默的大多数》 王小波 - The Silent Majority by Wang Xiaobo
* Sapiens: a brief history of humankind - Yuval Noah Harari
