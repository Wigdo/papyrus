I was out at a bar in the city attending a language exchange event called [Mundo Lingo](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ML.Melbourne.CBD/) and a doctor asked me; he said: "what does it take to learn Chinese?".

<p> And I said, "remembering 10,000 of anything is hard, it's a wonder that so many Chinese people are literate". </p>

 <p>"Isn't it inefficient?" </p>

<p> "Yes, it's definitely inefficient. But there's a usefulness to it. Just to become literate you need to develop a good work ethic, and you need to be dedicated to learning 10,000 characters just to be able to <em> read </em>. </p>    

<p>
So how many do you know?
</p>

<p> "hard to say, probably between 2500 and 3000." </p>

<p> He was learning French so I told him "Learning Chinese for four years is probably the equivalent of learning French for two. By the end of a BA in French you can probably read Voltaire, with Chinese you probably wouldn't be able to read a newspaper. </p>
