I was out at a bar in the city attending a language exchange event called [Mundo Lingo](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ML.Melbourne.CBD/) and a doctor asked me; he said: "what does it take to learn Chinese?".

<p> And I said, "remembering 10,000 of anything is hard, it's a wonder that so many Chinese people are literate". </p>

 <p>"isn't it inefficient?" </p>

<p> "Yes, it's definitely inefficient. But there's a usefulness to it. Just to become literate, you need to develop a good work ethic, and you need to be dedicated, just to be able to <em> read </em>. </p>
