After a friend suggesting I listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvh5gLt6AZQ) song (it starts 1:26) , I decided to translate it. It is very difficult to make idiomatic Chinese sound like idiomatic English without completely changing the author's meaning. Here, I have tried to capture the feel of the original, and have been lost some of the meaning of the original for that purpose.  
<p>
You can find my rough and ready translation below.

## English Lyrics （英文歌词）
*Ten Thousand Distinct Homes*
<p>
She went through the August flood. Tiantai dumped its bottomless ideals.
</p>
<p>
By the northern wind, by the reeds, she suddenly slept. The grasslands in her dream are boundless white.
</p>
<p>
The train went all about as did her joys and sorrows.
And it took her through every hometown.
A small temporary solace.
</p>
<p>
If you stand facing the rising sun is it possible to shake off yesterday's melancholy?
Can feeble words communicate my every worry?
</p>
<p>
If one day I lose my courage can I finish this journey?
If you traverse the world, you still only have one home.
The city's fluorescent lights illuminate the entire night's darkness.
</p>
<p>
Not like that youthful fearless age of growing...
She does not want much, it's just something different to everyone else
Candle light refracted in the water comes towards me.
Meet by chance but it's too short; not even enough time to wait for tea to cool.
You throw away a habit, but voraciously stay beside me.
</p>
<p>
If you stand facing the rising sun is it possible to shake off yesterday's melancholy?
Can feeble words communicate my every worry?
</p>

## Chinese Lyrics (original) 中文歌词（原版） ##
*历历万乡*

<p>
她住在七月的洪流上
天台倾倒理想一万丈
</p>

<p>
她午睡在北风
仓皇途经的芦苇荡
她梦中的草原白茫茫
列车搭上悲欢去辗转
她尝遍了每个异乡
限时赠送的糖
</p>
<p>
若我站在朝阳上
能否脱去昨日的惆怅
单薄语言能否传达我所有的牵挂
若有天我不复勇往
能否坚持走完这一场
踏遍万水千山总有一地故乡
城市慷慨亮整夜光
不此如同少年不惧岁月长
她想要的不多只是和别人的不一样
烛光倒影为我添茶
相逢太短不等茶水凉
你扔下的习惯还顽强活在我身上
</p>

<p>
若我站在朝阳上
能否脱去昨日的惆怅
单薄语言能否传达我所有的牵挂
若有天我不复勇往
能否坚持走完这一场
踏遍万水千山总有一地故乡
</p>
<p>
若我站在朝阳上
能否脱去昨日的惆怅
单薄语言能否传达我所有的牵挂
若有天我不复勇往
能否坚持走完这一场
踏遍万水千山总有一地故乡
她走在马蹄的余声中
夕阳燃烧离别多少场
</p>
她向陌生人们
解说陌生人的风光
等她归来坐下对我讲
故人旧时容颜未沧桑
我们仍旧想要
当初想要的不一样
